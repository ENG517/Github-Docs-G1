## Adding a Repository From Your Local Computer to Github Desktop

This tutorial will explain how to add a repository to Github Desktop, even if it did not originate from Github Desktop

There are two different methods that can be used to achieve this.

### Method #1

This method will be the same for both Windows and Mac systems

1) Have the Git repository open in one window, and Github Desktop open in another.
2) Drag the Git repository folder from the first window onto the {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %} window
3) You can also add multiple Git folders at the same time by dragging them into {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %}. Each folder will be added as a separate Git repository.

### Method #2

1. In the menu bar, select **File**, then click **Add Local Repository**.
